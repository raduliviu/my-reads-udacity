This is part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree. To quote the project description:
>In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## So, what's the deal?

This is a simple application. You have three shelves with books (Currently reading, Want to read, Read), and a Search page. The Seach page is linked to a back-end with predefined search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). You can move books between the respective shelves, and if you choose a shelf from a book from the Search page, it will show up in the right place when you go back to the Home page.

## Installation

To get up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project to your local machine
2. ```cd``` into the project directory
3. Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies
4. Run ```npm start``` to start the server

## Contributing

I did not start this project from scratch, but rather from the starter code already provided at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.
